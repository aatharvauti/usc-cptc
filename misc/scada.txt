## CoDeSys - 
The PLC / RTU that are part of this project are:
    3S CoDeSys
    GE D20
    Koyo / DirectLOGIC
    Rockwell Automation ControlLogix
    Schneider Electric Modicon

** 3S CoDeSys - ladder logic system on PLCs
codesys-shell.py -- unauthenticated user the ability to perform privileged operations, sans password. The commands available vary by PLC, so type “?” to get a list of options.
codesys-transfer.py --  a file transfer tool which allows for reading and writing files on controllers with a filesystem
^^ py scripts can easily be ported to be Metasploit modules, and could be made to run the Meterpreter shell on supported operating systems. ^^

** GE D20 RTU - ancient device used within electric sector
d20tftpbd - command line access with no auth; try typing the help command
d20pass - displays the account usernames and passwords from the GE D20 device configuration.
d20_tftp_overflow - DoS attack (DO NOT USE, only report on)
^^ all supposely in Metasploit

ged20cmd.py - same as MSF command line tool
ged20telnet-fp.py - fingerprint tool for controllers with telnet (USE WITH CARE, may crash some controllers)
ged20tftp.rb -- BoF (DO NOT USE, only report on)

** Koyo DirectLOGIC - lowend PLC device, not widely used except for small plants
koyobrute.rb - bruteforce 7 digit pw; use pw to download ladder logic & go from there.

**  Rockwell Automation ControlLogix - PLC
ethernetip-multi.rb
^^ MSF, BUT all about stopping/rebooting device (DO NOT USE)

** Schneider Electric Modicon - PLC usesd in water plants...
modicon_command – Schneider Modicon Remote Start/Stop Command
modicon_password_recovery – Schneider Modicon Quantum Password Recovery
modicon_stux_transfer – Schneider Modicon Ladder Logic Upload/Download
^^ PW Recovery best option, shows backdoor/default pw in usage. Others not so useful.

====== OLD TOOLS ========
plcscan 	Tool for scaning PLC devices over the s7comm or modbus protocol. 
ModScan 	ModScan is a new tool designed to map a SCADA MODBUS TCP based network.
